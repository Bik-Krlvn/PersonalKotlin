A journal android application to track your day to day activity

This sample shows how to use the libraries to build
a complete basic app that implements the recommended architecture
and can be used as a template for further explorations.

re-requisites
--------------

* Android Studio 3.0 or later and you know how to use it.

* Make sure Android Studio is updated, as well as your SDK and Gradle.
Otherwise, you may have to wait for a while until all the updates are done.

* A device or emulator that runs API level 22+

You need to be solidly familiar with the Kotlin programming language,
object-oriented design concepts, and Android Development Fundamentals.
In particular:

* RecyclerView and Adapters
* Room database and the SQLite query language
* Threading and AsyncTask
* It helps to be familiar with software architectural patterns that separate
  data from the user interface, such as MVP or MVC.
